Databricks Basic Exploration Project
Welcome to my introductory project on Databricks! üöÄ

This repository documents my learning journey as I explored the Databricks platform, with the sole purpose of understanding the Databricks File System (DBFS), how Databricks works as a platform, and gaining a practical introduction to Apache Spark.

üîç Project Overview
Hands-on Databricks: Navigated the Databricks UI, worked with notebooks, managed clusters, and built basic data pipelines.

DBFS Exploration: Learned how Databricks File System works for cloud-based data access and management.

Understanding Volumes: Experimented with how volumes organize and secure data.

Apache Spark Intro: Executed simple operations in Spark and observed its tight integration with the Databricks environment.

This project is intentionally simple, aimed at building foundational knowledge and confidence with a new tech stack. As part of my commitment to staying current with modern data tools, I wanted to share my experience and encourage others to start experimenting with these powerful platforms.
